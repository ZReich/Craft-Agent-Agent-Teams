## Implementation checklist

- Implement smallest component set that satisfies the spec
- Add loading/error/empty states
- Keyboard + focus behavior works end-to-end
- Add/adjust tests for key interactions and regressions

## “Done means”

- No TypeScript errors
- Unit/component tests cover primary flows
- A11y basics: labels, roles, focus order, tab navigation
