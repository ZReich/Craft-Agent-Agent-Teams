## Docs workflow

1. Identify changed behavior and impacted docs
2. Update reference docs with concrete examples
3. Add migration/upgrade notes when behavior changed
4. Verify links, commands, and paths are correct

## Documentation checklist

- What changed, why, and who is affected
- Exact commands/paths are copy-paste safe
- Version/scope notes are explicit

## Done means

- Docs match current implementation
- Reader can execute steps without guessing
- Follow-up doc debt is listed if deferred
