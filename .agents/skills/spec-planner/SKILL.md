description: Specification planning skill. Use to produce concise, testable requirements, acceptance tests, DRI ownership, and task decomposition before implementation.

## Planning workflow

1. Define problem statement and measurable success criteria
2. Write requirement IDs with scope boundaries
3. Attach acceptance tests per requirement
4. Assign DRI owner/reviewer and dependencies

## Output contract

- Requirements list (REQ-IDs)
- Acceptance tests mapped 1:1 to requirements
- Task decomposition with requirementIds and DRIs

## Done means

- Requirements are testable and non-overlapping
- Acceptance tests are implementation-ready
- Coverage plan can be tracked to 100%
